2) How to Build

$ open Movist.xcodeproj
and build it.

3) How to update libav

If you want to update to a new version of libav to get new codecs or bugfixes:
- Go into contrib/libav and do `git fetch` to get the latest remote versions of the source.
- Check out the code to whatever more recent version you want to use. (I always use tagged releases)
- Build. All the scripts are expecting to be called from Xcode so just do all your building from there. Xcode should show you any errors.
- Find all the errors and warnings due to API changes and fix them.
